# cov-rgb-bgr-converter

FIXME: description

## Installation

In the near future
usage will be soon available on dc9.x10host.com

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    - .jpg images don't work - return empty images at attempted usage
      w/ mikera library when trying to apply filters.
    - code looks ugly.  
    - only one export folder can be used - will add option so that user
      can store images in  different directories

## Options

   - Will take .png images only for filters.

## Examples

    - Examples of usage in -main (see core.clj inside src/)
      (display-image-invert-export "ant-2.jpg")
      (make-copy-image "ant.png)
      (grayScale-image-export "ant.png")

### TODO
    - MAP across a folder - convert all images to gray scale (TODO)
    - Preparing training data to look at

### DONE
    - Parse through the image DONE
    - Invert the pixels DONE 
    - Export it as a new photo or image DONE

### Bugs
    - jpg's won't allow filters 

### Any Other Sections / Sources
    - dc9.x10host.com

    - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kBer7h7ljCbCHqcyUikH0fisPEFGDV0e?usp=sharing (COVID-19 images/resources)

### That You Think
    - project will serve as a baseline to how to convert any image
      into grayscale. Will take in directories, check if image is a .png
      will do everything to prepare data for ML>

### Might be Useful
    - prepare.clj (we want to prepare nCov-2019 images soon - will serve as an example)
    - more COVID-CT images (have a libary of images stored offsite and in Google drive)

# cov-rgb-bgr-converter

FIXME: Make it able to do for all images. Create a pmap that will convert .jpgs -> .png's

## Installation

In the near future usage will be soon available on http://dc9.x10host.com/

## Usage

Drag images you want to be prepared into resources/
See images into trained and test directories

      (build-image-data-txt "nCov-training-set" "train-dir/" "test-dir/" "src/cov_rgb_bgr_converter/paths.txt" 52) ; with a txt file
      (generated-txt "CT_COVID/" "src/nCov.txt")
      (generated-txt "ants/" "src/path-ants.txt")
      (resize-image-export "exports/" "ants/ant.png" 100 100)
      (invert-image-export "exports/" "ants/ant.png")
      (grayscale-resize "exports/" "ants/ant.png" 100)
      (generated-txt "dog-cat/" "src/train-cat-dog.txt")
      (build-folder "training-set-name" "train-dir" "output-dir")
      (build-image-data-txt "training-set-name" "train-dir" "output-dir" "src/train-cat-dog.txt" 52) 
      
See examples of .txt generated in src/.

## Options
   - Will generate .txt file when you drag a folder into resources directory.
   - Will take .png files only (convert file using magick?)

## Examples
   - (see Usage)
            
### Directions
Steps: (will be implemented via commandline)
   - Build project in directory using leinigen
   - Drag folder of images into resources/
   - call 'lein repl'
   - call methods in core.clj

### TODO
- Implement it into a command line **BIG**
    - We want to automate the process 
      we want to be able to drag in any type of data set (nCov, dog and cat pictures, etc. , (.txt data))
        mkdir /test-nCov-test ... or future /test-[insert-data-set-name]
    - RESTFUL API (https://www.tutsmake.com/node-express-js-creating-a-restful-api-mysql-example/)
    - train the data (Fiverr look into it)
    - Show results (Via web server -> create app that will talk to processing backend)
    - take in .xlxs data spreadsheet or .txt
    
### Future ideas?
- Take in video files for interpolation (guess speed of vehicle - comma.ai challenge)
- .txt data (NLP)
- TBD.
    
### DONE
- Parse through the image. DONE
- Grayscale the pixels. DONE 
- Export it as a new photo or image. DONE
- mapping across a folder - convert all images to gray scale. DONE
- Preparing training data to look at. DONE
- Optional: create an autoupdate for paths.txt.
       - for instance, when user drags in a dataset into resources folder
          a paths.txt should be generated. DONE


### Bugs
- jpg's won't allow filters 

### Any Other Sections / Sources
- http://dc9.x10host.com/ (implement the functionality in the command line on my website)
- https://cljdoc.org/d/net.mikera/imagez/0.12.0/api/mikera.image.dither#greyscale-palette-function
- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kBer7h7ljCbCHqcyUikH0fisPEFGDV0e?usp=sharing (COVID-19 images/resources)

### That You Think
- project will serve as a baseline to how to convert any image
  into grayscale. Will take in directories, check if image is a .png
  will do everything to prepare data for ML.
- Library here will serve to prepare all types of data in the future (will be updated)
- generalized parameters -> user only has to drag images library into
  resources folder
- create a script that will update paths.txt?

### Might be Useful
- prepare-example.clj (we want to prepare nCov-2019 images soon - will serve as an example)
- more COVID-CT images (have a libary of images stored offsite and in Google drive)
   - Parse through the image DONE
   - grayscale the pixels DONE 
   - Export it as a new photo or image DONE

### Bugs
   - jpg's won't allow filters.
   - returns null on jpg images
